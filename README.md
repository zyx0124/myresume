EC601 homework2

This is the homework 2 for EC601,I used the online sources and modified the template to create my own resume pages.
Also, for the second part of my homework, I add a google sign-in authentication to my website based on the firebase.

The URL of my resume page is https://resumepage-154f0.firebaseapp.com/

For the unit test, there is a part one test black box testing, the result is uploaded as the test sheet file.

For the automated test, the URL of the monkey testing of the resume website is 
https://monkeytest.it/test/577951f9-5ab8-4bc9-af8e-1849352a76b8 it shows that there is a error on the onload link but good function on onclick event and broken links
